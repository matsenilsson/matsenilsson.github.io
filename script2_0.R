# Script2. Analyzing data from a psychoacoustic experiment (under construction) 
#
# The data is from a listening experiment (ALEXIS 106) involving blind and sighted 
# listeners, conducted at the Gösta Ekman Laboratory in 2016. The experiment measured 
# auditory thresholds for abilities potentially important for human echolocation.
# The data is stored in two files. The first contain threshold data, 
# the second background data (age, sex, ...). Please see the file codebooks.txt
# for details on the variables stored in the data files.
