# Notes REX106
I know of no better software than R for plotting data. R gives you full 
control of every element of the output; you can build the graph from bottom up, step by step, adding one element at a time.  

Note: In the code examples below, I name each function argument also when not necessary, like this:`plot(x = exposure, y = outcome)`, although `plot(exposure, outcome)` would have worked equally well (if you provide the arguments in the order specified by the functions help-page, names are not necessary). Naming arguments, also when not necessary, is good practice, because it helps the reader to understand the code (the reader could be you in 7 months, when all this might be forgotten).

### Building a plot
Below is an example of how to build a plot from bottom up. It uses R's 
data set sleep: Two groups tested on two sleeping drugs; the outcome is the amount of extra sleep.

```{r, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 5}
# Load data
g2 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 2]  # Extra sleep Group 2
g1 <- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1]  # Extra sleep Group 1

# Create an empty plot
plot(x = NULL, xlim = c(0.5, 2.5), ylim = c(-2, 6), axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE)

# Add line for no effect
lines(x = c(0.5, 2.5), y = c(0, 0), lty = 2)

# Add data points for group 1, slighlty displaced (jittered) along x.
jitter <- rnorm(n = length(g1), mean = 0, sd = 0.02) 
points(x = 1 + jitter, y = g1, pch = 21, bg = 'green')

# Add error bar +/- 1 standard deviation for group 1 (more on error bars below)
arrows(x0 = 1.25, y0 = mean(g1) - sd(g1),
       x1 = 1.25, y1 = mean(g1) + sd(g1), 
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 3)

# Add mean value for group 1
points(x = 1.25, y = mean(g1), pch = 21, bg = 'green')

# Add data points for group 2
points(x = 2 + jitter, y = g2, pch = 22, bg = 'lightblue')

# Add error bar +/- 1 standard deviation for group 2
arrows(x0 = 1.75, y0 = mean(g2) - sd(g2),
       x1 = 1.75, y1 = mean(g2) + sd(g2), 
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 3)

# Add mean value for group 2
points(x = 1.75, y = mean(g2), pch = 22, bg = 'lightblue')

# Add x-axis
axis(side = 1, at = c(0.5, 1, 2, 2.5), labels = c('', 'Group 1', 'Group 2', ''), 
     tck = 0.01, pos = -2, cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0, 0))

# Add y-axis
axis(side = 2, at = seq(-2, 6), labels = seq(-2, 6), 
     tck = 0.01, pos = 0.5,  cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0.5, 0), las = 1)

# Add x-axis text
mtext(text = "Experimental group", side = 1, line = 1, cex = 0.9)

# Add y-axis text
mtext(text = "Extra sleep [hours]", side = 2, line = 1.2, cex = 0.9)

# Add info on error bars (new line: \n   plus-minus sign:   \u00B1)
text(x = 0.6, y = 5.6, labels = "Error bars:\n\u00B1 1 stand. dev.", 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
```

\  
\  

### Plots with subplots
It's easy to create subplots with the command `par(mfrow=c())`. This changes the 
plotting default from a single plot (`par(mfrow=c(1, 1))`), to whatever number 
of plots you like. This example places three plots in one row:
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
my_data <- rexp(n = 100)
hist(x = my_data, main = '', xlab = 'My data')
boxplot(x = my_data, ylab = 'My data')
stripchart(x = my_data, vertical = TRUE, method = 'jitter')
```

Here is another example that arranges six plots in two rows and three columns.
This code also illustrates how to generate multiple plots using `lapply()` (very 
powerful, e.g., if you want to plot data for each participant in an large 
experiment).

```{r, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 5}
plot_binom <- function(p, n = 10) {
  # Function that plots the binomial distribution
  plot(x = 0:10, y = dbinom(x = seq(0:n), size = n, prob = p), 
       type = 'h', ylim = c(0, 0.35), 
       xlab = 'x', ylab = 'P(X = x)')
  text(x = 2, y = 0.33, labels = paste('p =', p), cex = 0.7)
}

# Sets default to put succesive plots in a 2x3 grid
par(mfrow=c(2, 3))

# Arguments for plot_binom()
p <- c(0.2, 0.32, 0.44, 0.56, 0.68, 0.80)  

# Applies plot_binom() separately to each element of p
myplots <- lapply(p, plot_binom)

# This restores the default
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```
  
\  
\  

Modifying the default value of `mfrow:` `par(mfrow = c(1, 1))`, does not allow 
subplots of different sizes (as far as I know). If that is what you want, instead 
modify the default value of `fig:` `par(fig = c(0, 1, 0, 1)`. It's four arguments 
specify a proportion of the plotting window, for example, `par(fig = c(0, 1, 0.5, 1)` 
would locate the subplot so as to cover the upper half of the plotting area 
(from 0 to 100 % along the horizontal dimension, and from 50 to 100 % along the 
vertical dimension). Here is an example with two subplots:  
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
# Create some random data
set.seed(123)
sound_level <- seq(from = 40, to = 90, by = 5)
annoyance_train <- 10 + sound_level * 0.5 + rnorm(length(sound_level))
annoyance_truck <- 2 + sound_level * 0.8 + rnorm(length(sound_level))

# Plot a scattergram to the left (to cover 70 % of the plotting area)
par(fig = c(0, 0.7, 0, 1),  # Define plotting area
    mar = c(4,4,1,1))  # Set margins of subplot (explained below)
plot(x = sound_level, y = annoyance_train, ylim = c(25, 75), pch = 21, bg = 'green',
     xlab = 'Sound pressure level [dB]', ylab = 'Mean annoyance rating', cex.axis = 0.7)
points(x = sound_level, y = annoyance_truck, ylim = c(25, 75), pch = 22, bg = 'grey')

# A boxplot to the right, covering the remaing 30 % of the plotting area
par(fig = c(0.7, 1, 0, 1),   
    mar = c(4, 2, 1, 1), new = TRUE)  # new = TRUE adds it to the active plot 
boxplot(annoyance_train, annoyance_truck, ylim = c(25, 75),  col = c('green', 'grey'), 
        xlab = 'Sound type', names = c('Train', 'Truck'), cex.axis = 0.7)
```

The default value of `mar` (margins): `par(mar=c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))` sets the 
size of the so called inner margins of the plot, i.e., the space outside the axes 
(unit: lines). You may want to change these settings to fine adjust your 
subplots; extensive trial and error typically is needed to get it perfect.

\ 
\ 

### Error bars
Above I used the function `arrows()` to create one error bar at the time. Here 
an example how to use it to create multiple error bars in one go.

```{r}
# Simulate some data
set.seed(123)
alcohol <- rep(x = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2), times = 20)
mistakes <- 10 + 0.4 * alcohol + 0.6 * (alcohol - 2)^2 +
            rnorm(n = length(alcohol), mean = 0, sd = 0.8 * (alcohol + 2))
alc_levels <- unique(alcohol)
m_mistakes <- tapply(mistakes, list(alcohol), mean)
sd_mistakes <- tapply(mistakes, list(alcohol), sd)

# Plot scattergram with means +/- 1 sd
plot(x = NULL, xlim = c(-1, 11), ylim = c(0, 60), axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE)
arrows(x0 = alc_levels, y0 = m_mistakes - sd_mistakes,
       x1 = alc_levels, y1 = m_mistakes + sd_mistakes,
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 3)  # See help(arrows) for details
points(x = alc_levels, y = m_mistakes, pch = 21, bg = 'grey')

# Add axes etc.
axis(side = 1, at = c(-1, alc_levels, 11), labels = c('', alc_levels, ''),
     pos = 0, tck = 0.01, mgp = c(3, 0.3, 0))
axis(side = 2, las = 1, tck = 0.01, pos = -1, mgp = c(3, 0.5, 0))
mtext(side = 1, text = 'Alcohol intake [cl]', line = 1.3)
mtext(side = 2, text = 'Mean number of mistakes', line = 1.5)
text(x = -1, y = 57, labels = "Error bars:\n\u00B1 1 stand. dev.", 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
```

\ 

Here I add one experimental group to the example above. To avoid cluttered error 
bars, I only plot them in one direction, upwards for the group with higher mean 
values, and downward for the group with lower mean values.
```{r}
set.seed(321)
mistakes_g2 <- 4 + 0.4 * alcohol + 0.6 * (alcohol - 2)^2 +
            rnorm(n = length(alcohol), mean = 0, sd = 0.8 * (alcohol + 2))
m_mistakes_g2 <- tapply(mistakes_g2, list(alcohol), mean)
sd_mistakes_g2 <- tapply(mistakes_g2, list(alcohol), sd)

# Plot scattergram with means +/- 1 sd
plot(x = NULL, xlim = c(-1, 11.5), ylim = c(0, 60), axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE)

# Data group 1
arrows(x0 = alc_levels, y0 = m_mistakes,
       x1 = alc_levels, y1 = m_mistakes + sd_mistakes,
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 2)  # See help(arrows) for details
points(x = alc_levels, y = m_mistakes, pch = 24, bg = 'grey')

# Data group 2 
arrows(x0 = alc_levels, y0 = m_mistakes_g2 - sd_mistakes_g2,
       x1 = alc_levels, y1 = m_mistakes_g2,
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 1)  # See help(arrows) for details
points(x = alc_levels, y = m_mistakes_g2, pch = 25, bg = 'blue')

# Add axes etc.
axis(side = 1, at = c(-1, alc_levels, 11), labels = c('', alc_levels, ''),
     pos = 0, tck = 0.01, mgp = c(3, 0.3, 0))
axis(side = 2, las = 1, tck = 0.01, pos = -1, mgp = c(3, 0.5, 0))
mtext(side = 1, text = 'Alcohol intake [cl]', line = 1.3)
mtext(side = 2, text = 'Mean number of mistakes', line = 1.5)
text(x = -1, y = 57, labels = "Error bars:\n\u00B1 1 stand. dev.", 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
text(x = 10, y = max(m_mistakes) + 2, labels = 'Group 1', col = 'black', 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
text(x = 10, y = max(m_mistakes_g2) - 2, labels = 'Group 2', col = 'blue', 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
```

\ 

It is of course possible to plot double error bars. Here an example with made up data: assessments of three photographs on two scales, Valence (degree of pleasantness) and Arousal (degree of activation). 
``` {r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
# Make up some data
valence_mdn <- c(-2.0,  0.5,  4.0)
valence_q1  <- c(-2.6, -0.9,  3.1) 
valence_q3  <- c(-1.5,  1.1,  4.5)
arousal_mdn <- c( 4.0, -3.0, -0.5)
arousal_q1  <- c( 3.7, -4.5, -1.7) 
arousal_q3  <- c( 4.8, -1.6,  0.6)

# Empty scattergram
plot(x = NULL, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5), axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE)

# Bars along x-axis: quartile 1 --- quartile 3
arrows(x0 = valence_q1, y0 = arousal_mdn,
       x1 = valence_q3, y1 = arousal_mdn,
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 3)  # See help(arrows) for details
# Bars along y-axis: quartile 1 --- quartile 3
arrows(x0 = valence_mdn, y0 = arousal_q1,
       x1 = valence_mdn, y1 = arousal_q3,
       length = 0.05, angle = 90, code = 3)  # See help(arrows) for details
# Add median values
points(x = valence_mdn, y = arousal_mdn, pch = 21, bg = 'lightblue')

# Add axes etc.
axis(side = 1, pos = -5, at = seq(-5, 5), tck = 0.01, 
     cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0.3, 0))
axis(side = 2, pos = -5, at = seq(-5, 5), tck = 0.01, 
     cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0.5, 0), las = 1)
mtext(side = 1, text = 'Median pleasantness rating', line = 1.3)
mtext(side = 2, text = 'Median arousal rating', line = 1.5)
text(x = -0, y = 4.5, labels = "Bars:\nquartile 1 - quartile 3", 
     cex = 0.7, font = 3, pos = 4)
```

### Exporting plots to .pdf or .png
For publication, you need to expprt your plot to a suitable file format. The 
pdf-format is vector based and thereby possible to scale up and down without loss 
of information. This format is accepted by most publishers. Unfortunately it is 
not easily incorporated in a standard word-prcessor file or on a web page. For this you need a pixel based file format, and teh one most seem to be recommending nowdays 
is the png-format.  

Use the function `pdf()` to export your figure in a specified size to a pdf-file. The code generates no output except the file so you have to open the file to see what you 
got. I warn you: Your figure will probably look terribly the first time; you 
need to practice trial-and-error for a while to get it right, primarily by changing 
sizes of symbols, axis numbers, text elements, etc. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# pdf() takes inches as input, dived by 25.4 to get mm
inch <- 25.4

# The figure generated below this line will be exported in pdf-format, with
# size 160 mm x 90 mm
pdf("fig01.pdf", width = 150/inch, height = 90/inch)

# Just a histogram
set.seed(123)
hist(x = rexp(1e4), breaks = 100, main = '', axes = FALSE, ann = FALSE)
axis(side = 1, at = seq(0, 10, 1), tck = 0.01, pos = 0, 
     cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0, 0))
axis(side = 2, at = seq(0, 1e3, 100), tck = 0.01, pos = 0, 
     cex.axis = 0.7, mgp = c(3, 0.5, 0), las = 1)
mtext(text = "x", side = 1, line = 1, cex = 0.9)
mtext(text = "Frequency", side = 2, line = 1.2, cex = 0.9)
info <- '10,000 observations drawn from an exponential distribution'
text(x = 1, y = 900, info, cex = 0.6, font = 3, pos = 4)
dev.off()  # You have to close the 'device' before you can open your pdf
```

For a .png file, replace the above line 
`pdf(...)` with  
`png("fig01.png", width = 150, height = 90, unit = 'mm', res = 600)`, for a png 
file with a resolution of 600 pixels per inch.  

Here is what it looks like after I saved it as .png, and then red it into this 
webside: ![](fig01.png)
