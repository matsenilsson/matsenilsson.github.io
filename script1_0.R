# Script1. Randomized experiment (final) 
#
# The simulated scenario is a simple randomized experiment on the effect of extra 
# music lessons on math performance.
#
# Simulated variables:
#  1. Independent variable: At the start of grade 6, all children at a specific 
#     school are randomly assigned to receive either extra music lessons (treatment) 
#     or no extra music lessons (control).    
#  2. Background (or pre-treatment) variable: Socioeconomic status, defined based 
#     on residential area (either high-income or low-income area). 
#  3. Outcome variable: Score on math test taken at the end of the semester.
