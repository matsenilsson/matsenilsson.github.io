Codebooks for two data files used in the REX seminars, fall 2016
Mats Nilsson, revised 2016-12-01

The data is from a listening experiment involving blind and sighted listeners, 
conducted at the GÃ¶sta Ekman Laboratory in 2016. The experiment measured 
auditory thresholds for abilities potentially important for human echolocation.
 
The data is stored in two files. Te first contain threshold data, 
the second background data (age, sex, ...).

File: threshold_data.txt ---------------------------------------------
Column 1: id
Four digit number unique to each listener. Blind listeners have numbers from 6001,
sighted listeners have numbers in the range 1001-2099. There are two groups of
sighted listeners:
(1) "young": below 40 y, all have numbers starting with 1, and
(2) "age-matched": each member of this group is matched in age with a blind
listener, pairs are identified by the last two digits of the id (e.g., sighted
listener 2071 is matched with blind listener 6071).

Column 2: cond
1 = intensity discrimination, 2 = correlated-noise detection,
3 = correlated-noise discrimination, 4 = spectral-shape detection

Column 3: th
Threshold estimate, mean of five runs of each condition (less then five if 
outliers were excluded). Thresholds for conditions 1, 2 and 4 art in decibel, 
threholds for condition 3 are in samples (sampling frequency = 96 kHz). Please 
note that low values mean good hearing abilitiy (the lower, the better!).

Column 4: outlier
The number of outliers excluded from the threshold estimates.

Column 5: group
1 = sighted young
2 = sighted age-matched
3 = blind

File: background_data.txt ------------------------------------------------------
Column 1: id
As for threshold_data.txt, see above

Column 2: sex
1 = female
2 = male

Column 3: age
Age in years. Calculated from biorth date and test date; age rounded to nearest
integer (45.6 years old -> 67 y)

Column 4: group
As for threshold_data.txt, see above

Columns 5-11: right250, ..., right6000
Audiometric threhold right ear, for frequencies 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 
and 6k Hz. Missing data: NA

Columsn 12-18: left250, ..., left6000
Audiometric threhold left ear, for frequencies 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 
and 6k Hz. Missing data: NA

Column 19: echolocator
Self-reported use of echolocation. Question asked only to blind participants.
"How often do you use echolocation to navigate in the environment?"
1 = "Never"
2 = "Sometimes"
3 = "Often"
4 = "Almost always"
Missing data: NA (all sighted participants)
